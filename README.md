# SQL-Database-Project
The following is a project which contains the database for an e-commerce company named SneakerDrop, which specializes in the retail of sneakers.  This database/site will display the Entity/Relation diagram, the relational model displaying relations to the database design, the database functionality and user interface. This will allow the administration to data-analyze various purchase patterns and maximize sales. We will create the interactions with the database using SQL and we will create the website using HTML/Javascript.
